# io_scene_rmf
Blender 2.80 addon for importing Rich Map Format (rmf) map files used in the GoldSrc engine.

This addon was created to aid artists in modeling assets around a level's geometry.

## Features
* Imports all brushes from RMF file.
* Organizes brushes into collections (eg. sky, clip, trigger, brush entities).

## Limitations
Textures and texture coordinates are not currently being imported as they had no value in the original application.
